# Contributing

We currently accept minor fixes and program improvements. This project is mostly designed to be some sort of personal portfolio, so no new programs are being accepted.

## Info

## Setting up an environment

Fork and pull the project locally. Depending on what program you're trying to edit, open an appropriate folder and open .sln file in Visual Studio. You should now be ready to compile and run the project locally.

## Submitting your changes

After making sure the code compiles and runs without runtime exceptions (at least when used normally, no edge cases), commit and push your changes and create a pull request. In PR, please, state your changes and what they should do (and why you think it's good for the project).

## Major project changes

At the moment, we don't accept new programs and big features that go out of the main scope of the program.
